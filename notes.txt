- use some library to get all the tables in all the pages of the pdf
- and then clean it
- and dump the data into a relational database
- based on timestamp
- if timestamp exists then donot update, but this can be only true if the
transcation is done from the same card , a person can have multiple 
credit cards.
- lets keep it simple for now, and proceed , i.e timestamps of two 
transactions cannot be same
- first dashboard should show a pie chart with bifurcation of 
money spent



- i am now thinking of data directly from 
various banks api and set up an Airflow pipeline to do the same
daily
